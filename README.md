Redis Caching Demo with help of EngineeringDigest youtube Channel.

In order to run this Springboot application locally, we need following things
-- MySQL DB running on port 3306 with schema redis_demo
-- Redis Server running on port 6379
  -- Open Ubuntu software in your windows
  -- Run command to start redis server : 'sudo service redis-server start'
  -- Then give the password, you'd have set while configuring redis
  -- Then run the redis cli using command 'redis-cli'
  -- Then for testing purpose run 'ping' cmnd and you'd see PONG in response
