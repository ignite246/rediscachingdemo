Redis Caching Demo with help of EngineeringDigest youtube Channel.

In order to run this Springboot application locally, we need following things
1. MySQL DB running on port 3306 with schema redis_demo
2. Redis Server running on port 6379
3. Open Ubuntu software in your windows
4. Run command to start redis server : 'sudo service redis-server start'
5. Then give the password, you'd have set while configuring redis
6. Then run the redis cli using command 'redis-cli'
7. Then for testing purpose run 'ping' cmnd and you'd see PONG in response
